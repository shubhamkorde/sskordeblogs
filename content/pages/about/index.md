_Meet Shubham Korde!_


Shubham has existed on this planet since 2001. He celebrates his birthday on the 14th of October. He was brought up in a typical Indian, nuclear conservative family. His mother says he used to be quite chubbyâ™¥ but a big crybaby ðŸ˜’ in his childhood. He spent his early childhood days playing cricket in scorchy summers, playing computer games ðŸ˜Ž and watching cartoons on television.

In 2011, he moved to the historical city of Aurangabad with his family. He joined Ryan International School as a fifth grader in Aurangabad. He spent time there dancing in the morning assemblies, playing Dragon City & Farmville ðŸ¤© on Facebook and playing cricket. Shifting back to Mumbai, he joined Meridian School in 2014. Here he met some friends with whom he had some of the best memories of his life ðŸ¥°. Here, he tried many things like participating in olympiads ðŸ¤”, doing projects for science exhibitions and learning salsa ðŸ˜Ž. Towards the end of his schooling life, he learned about the exam IIT-JEE, which all smart-confused-science-lovers-school-topper kids give. That was it; he decided to write this exam two years later. He then spent the two most gruelling, challenging, depressing years of his life. Spending most of his time at his study table, travelling for hours in the jam-packed local trains of Mumbai and struggling to cover up the massive JEE syllabus taught him some of the best lessons of his lifeðŸ˜£. In 2019, he wrote the JEE advanced and cleared it âœŒ. Soon, he entered IIT Kanpur as an excited, confused, under-confident freshman.

He left home and was on his own for the first time. At IITK, he met some incredible people ðŸ˜², made crazy friends ðŸ¥³ (ending up doing crazy things) and learnt many life lessons. Then some idiot ate a bat, and the entire world went crazy. He went back home to stay safe with his parents. He studied over the internet for the next one and half years. During the lockdown, he mostly spent his time studying brain-melting mathematics in Electrical Engineering, debating in his free time and participating in the rat race to get a good internship & job. As things became normal, he came to IITK to spend another memorable semester with the fantastic people there. He spent his time partying with his friends alongside academics. He left for Bangalore to do an internship, where he met six more amazing people with whom he became very close friends. He then spent another semester preparing for the placements alongside partying and making great memories. He then decided to write everything down for once so everyone could know, and here we are. 

## Life Philosophy

Doing things that no one can do gives a kick in life.

Everyone should work to make themselves better at all times. 

One can achieve anything if one can work hard enough.

Take care of big things and forget about the smaller things.

It is not about the place, money or things. It is about the people. It's always about the people.

If you are not happy when you see your body in the mirror, hit the fucking gym.

## Interests and Hobbies

**Robotics:-** I love Robotics. It was my childhood dream to make hi-tech stuff. I lead the software subsystem of team AUV-IITK. I have worked on many aspects of Autonomous Vehicles like autonomous navigation, controls and vision. I have learnt many new things, primarily in autonomous robotic navigation and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping. I led my team in RoboSub 2021, which was unfortunately held online, and now I am working in an advisory capacity in the team.

**Debating:-** I am very passionate about debating. I have liked public speaking since my school days. I was the coordinator of the Debate and Discussion Society, IITK. I have participated in multiple National and International Debating tournaments as an adjudicator and speaker. 

**Web Development:-** I explored Web Development during my first two years at university. I mainly explored the frontend frameworks (React & Angular) of Web Development and had a rudimentary understanding of backend frameworks (Express) and no-SQL databases (MongoDB). I spent significant time contributing to open source organization Oppia, learning many things. 

I loved playing computer games (right since my childhood). I used to be a really crazy Call of Duty gamer. I also used to spend a lot of time playing FIFA. However, I don't game much nowadays because of my busy schedule. In addition to that, I have now permanently migrated to Linux. I despise Windows and Microsoft. 

I love staying fit and muscle-building. I try to work out daily. Although I am not particularly good at any sport, I love playing all sorts of sports like Cricket (Pace Bowling), Football (Goal Keeping) and many others.

I sometimes also watch TV Series. I avoid them because they are too time-consuming. However, I have watched the cliche sitcoms like Friends, Big Bang Theory and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Some newest additions to the list are Suits and Silicon Valley.

I love listening to music. My favourite bands are One-Direction and Linkin Park.
